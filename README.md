# CodSoft Internship - Data Science Projects

This repository contains the projects I worked on during my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. The projects cover various domains and demonstrate different aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Below are the details of each project

## Projects Overview

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a classification model to estimate the probability of survival.

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- **Outcome**: A model to predict the likelihood of survival for each passenger based on various features.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python

Developing a system to predict movie ratings based on user reviews and metadata. The project includes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data and machine learning models to predict ratings.

- **Dataset**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)
- **Techniques**: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF, Sentiment Analysis, Regression Models
- **Outcome**: A model that predicts movie ratings based on review text and other metadata.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

Classifying iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using various classification algorithms. The project is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem.

- **Dataset**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- **Techniques**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests
- **Outcome**: A classifier that accurately predicts the species of an iris flower based on its morphological features.

### 4. Sales Prediction Using Python

Forecasting future sales based on historical sales data. The project involves time series analysis and regression models to predict sales figures.

- **Dataset**: Custom sales data
- **Techniques**: Time Series Analysis, ARIMA, Linear Regression, Feature Engineering
- **Outcome**: A predictive model that estimates future sales, helping in inventory and resource planning.

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on identifying patterns indicative of fraud and building models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Techniques**: Data imbalance handling, Anomaly Detection, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Outcome**: A robust fraud detection system that can identify potentially fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
